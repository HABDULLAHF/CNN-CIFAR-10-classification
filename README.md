# CNN-CIFAR-10-classification


train a multi-classification model on a dataset of images using the convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture. The dataset that you will use is the CIFAR-10 dataset, which consists of 60,000 32x32 color images in 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class. The goal is to build a model that can accurately classify each image into one of the 10 classes.

Instructions:

Download and preprocess the CIFAR-10 dataset. Split the data into training and testing sets. Build a convolutional neural network using TensorFlow or PyTorch. The architecture of the model is up to you, but it should include convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. Train the model on the training set using an appropriate optimizer and loss function. Experiment with different hyperparameters to improve the performance of the model. Evaluate the performance of the trained model on the testing set. Report the accuracy of the model and a confusion matrix to visualize the performance of the model on each class. Fine-tune the model to improve its performance. Experiment with techniques such as data augmentation, dropout, batch normalization, and transfer learning to further improve the performance of the model. Submit a report detailing the architecture of the model, the hyperparameters used, and the performance of the model on the testing set.
Include visualizations of the confusion matrix and any other relevant metrics. Dataset: The CIFAR-10 dataset can be downloaded from the following link: https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html
